# Hi, I'm Henry 👋
⚖️ I'm a lawyer-turned-business-analyst from Australia who found an absolute love for programming. 

🎨 I want to build beautiful web apps, so am learning the technologies on the front-end. Specifically, I'm learning things like _HTML_, _CSS_, _vanilla JavaScript_ and _React_, and am actively building things with them here. 

💯 I also use Python to grind Leetcode, and script away manual tasks.

Thank you for visiting!
