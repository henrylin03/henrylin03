💻 I'm a self-taught programmer with a love for designing simple UX, and bringing them to life with code. 

⚙️ I found my love for programming as an analyst/designer; designing, implementing, and maintaining user-centric web applications that automated thousands of hours of work for my customers and colleagues.

📖 I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, completing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s "Full Stack JavaScript" course.
